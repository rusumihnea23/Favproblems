The task solved had the following requirements:
  course_grading_part_1 -Please write a program which asks the user for the names of these two files, reads the files, and then prints out the total number of exercises completed by each student.
  
  histogram -Please write a function named histogram, which takes a string as its argument. The function should print out a histogram representing the number of times each letter occurs in the string. Each occurrence of a letter should be represented by a star on the specific line for that letter.
  
  matrix -The file matrix.txt contains a matrix in the format specified in the example below:

1,0,2,8,2,1,3,2,5,2,2,2
9,2,4,5,2,4,2,4,1,10,4,2
...etc...
Please write two functions, named matrix_sum and matrix_max. Both go through the matrix in the file, and then return the sum of the elements or the element with the greatest value, as the names of the functions imply.
Please also write the function row_sums, which returns a list containing the sum of each row in the matrix.

  numbers_spelled_out-Please write a function named dict_of_numbers(), which returns a new dictionary. The dictionary should have the numbers from 0 to 99 as its keys. The value attached to each key should be the number spelled out in words.
  
  recipe_search -This exercise is about creating a program which allows the user to search for recipes based on their names, preparation times, or ingredients used. The program should read the recipes from a file submitted by the user.

Each recipe consists of three or more lines. The first line has the name of the recipe, the second line contains an integer number representing the preparation time in minutes, and the remaining line or lines contain the ingredients used, one on each line. The recipe ends with an empty line, with the exception of the final recipe in the file which just ends with the end of the file.

  student_databse -First write a function named add_student, which adds a new student to the database. Also write a preliminary version of the function print_student, which prints out the information of a single student. Please write a function named add_course, which adds a completed course to the information of a specific student in the database. The course data is a tuple consisting of the name of the course and the grade.Courses with grade 0 should be ignored when adding course information. Additionally, if the course is already in the database in that specific student's information, the grade recorded in the database should never be lowered if the course is repeated.Please write a function named summary, which prints out a summary based on all the information stored in the database.
  
  phone_book_v2 -Please write an improved version of the phone book application. Each entry should now accommodate multiple phone numbers. The application should work otherwise exactly as above, but this time all numbers attached to a name should be printed.
